# Fraud Detection with Decision Trees  

A simple fraud detection system using **Decision Trees**. The model analyzes transaction data to identify fraudulent activities.  

## Features  

- Loads and processes transaction data  
- Trains a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Optimizes the model using pruning  
- Evaluates accuracy and recall  
- Identifies the most important fraud-related feature  

## Tech Stack  

- **Python**  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn  

## How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python Fraud_Detection_Decision_Tree.py
   ```

## Example Output  

```
Test Accuracy: 95.3%, Recall: 88.7%  
Most Important Feature: transactionAmount  
```
